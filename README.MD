****************************************************************************** 
NOTE:  That I have no data at all, when you use the application as intended like creating account and adding anime to the watching list it will create a collection by itself for users and watching list to the localhost database under the db name called “animebin”. Also, mongoDb should be run in localhost with port 27017
